# PCB Design Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of PCB design projects! This repository showcases my skills and experience in PCB design, focusing on projects done for my Formula SAE Electric Team, Nittany Motorsports!

## About Me
I am an Electrical Engineering student with a minor in Computer Engineering at Penn State University, experienced in PCB layout, circuit design, and testing. Apart from my work as a project manager for Nittany Motorsports, I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant. My research focuses on power delivery applications in the semiconductor packaging industry.

## Projects

### 1. **Megaboard Front**
- **Description:** This board is responsible for controlling key aspects of the race vehicle. It is built around an STM32F4 and contains various features that allow the vehicle to function as designed and adhere to all regulations.
- **Key Features:**
  - Custom power delivery architecture with multi-stage voltage regulation to ensure maximum efficiency.
  - Integration of high-speed components on the same board as sensitive analog circuits.
  - Integration of multiple safety circuits as required by the rulebook.
- **3D Renderings:**

### 2. **Megaboard Rear**
- **Description:** This board is responsible for controlling key aspects of the race vehicle. It is built around an STM32F4 and contains various features that allow the vehicle to function as designed and adhere to all regulations.
- **Key Features:**
  - Custom power delivery architecture with multi-stage voltage regulation to ensure maximum efficiency.
  - Integration of high-speed components on the same board as sensitive analog circuits.
  - Integration of both high-voltage and low-voltage circuits on the same board while ensuring necessary isolation.
  - Includes an ESP32 microcontroller utilized for Over-The-Air (OTA) software updates and telemetry.

### 3. **BMS Segment PCB (ADBMS6830B)**
- **Description:** Developed a Battery Management System (BMS) segment PCB centered around the ADBMS6830B. This PCB is custom-built to fit exactly on top of one of our high-voltage battery segments. It is designed to monitor and discharge all 16 cells on a segment and is built to endure high EMI and noise commonly found inside large high-voltage battery packs.
- **Key Features:**
  - High-precision cell voltage monitoring.
  - Dual isoSPI channels.
  - Stackup configured to minimize noise across the PCB.
